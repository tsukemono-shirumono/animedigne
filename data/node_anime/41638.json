    "description": "Chashin was selected by the legendary choicar \"Stormbone,\" as the strongest racer, and will showcase a new concept of bite racing. Bite racing is a new racing game that never hits a rail with two cars chasing in a match. The bite-free rail running on the track creates a more realistic racing experience. Various types of super cars such as speed type, balance type, and power type create unique racing on 3 types of tracks (crash track, line track, outdoor race). (Source: enewstoday.co.kr)",
